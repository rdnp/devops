# A Summary of the DevOps Handbook

This repository contains my personal summary of The DevOps Handbook by Gene Kim et al.

The summary is fairly detailed, as I point out what I find important in it. However, it is completely lacking the case studies and much more detailed information within the book, especially how to apply the knowledge in practice. So if you
re interested in the topic, read the book:
